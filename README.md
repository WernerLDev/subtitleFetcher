# subtitleFetcher

Improved version of my previous ScalaSubtitleFetcher. This time written in TypeScript. This implementation also uses the new API from opensubtitles.com.

Still Under development.

## Run locally

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

To download a subtitle run the following command:

Run `ts-node src/main.ts --movie <path to moviefile> --language en`
